Wrote of website layout from [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpKkuKV3KLE&t=1109s), but I changed:
1. whole design I rewrote on scss file;
2. some responsive design;
3. made minification scss and js files;
4. improved performance, special abilities, recomendation and search engine optimization.
